# MicroEconSim

This is a microeconomics simulator where firms and consumers can be scaled up and down. Firms will calculate their price based on the projected demand curve and the other firm's prices. 

The prices are stable and shift up with more buyers or greedier buyers and down with more firms. 

In short, the laws of supply and demand are simulated with a rational agent model.
